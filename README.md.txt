This is the first time I've worked with Unity and a game engine. Please excuse additional assets that are not required unclean appearances of the scenes as they will improve soon. 

## How to use each scene

Run each scene in unity and perform the following actions in the game window:

### Camera Controller scene

Character moves with WASD and mouse for rotation.
Press "E" to switch between third person camera and overhead camera.

### Particle Effects Scene

Click to fire a randomized particle effect with a pointlight originating from the smaller cube. 

I hope to create a more detailed version of the particle effect demo with a first person shooter style (similar to the brackeys' demo) by this weekend, unfortunately after the deadline. 

I learned that there are many ways to create both controllers and design particle effects. I don't believe I have the blender talent and capability to design my own projectiles and effects as shown in the given tutorial but I would like to do simple raycast particle effects as shown in the Brackeys tutorial. 

Thank you!
